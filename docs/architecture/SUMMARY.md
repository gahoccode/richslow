- **Phase 3**: Microservices, caching, database persistence
- **Frontend Migration**: Evolution to React SPA when needed

## Documentation Features

### C4 Model Visualization
- **Level 1**: System context with external integrations
- **Level 2**: Container architecture showing services
- **Level 3**: Component-level detailed architecture
- **Level 4**: Code organization and structure

### Quality Attributes
- **Performance**: Targets and monitoring strategies
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and error handling
- **Security**: Threat model and mitigation strategies
- **Maintainability**: Code quality and testing standards
- **Observability**: Monitoring and alerting

### Decision Documentation
- **Rationale**: Clear explanations for architectural choices
- **Trade-offs**: Honest assessment of pros and cons
- **Alternatives**: Considered options and why they were rejected
- **Future-proof**: Evolution paths and migration strategies

## Usage Guidelines

### Running Documentation Generation
```bash
# Generate all documentation
./scripts/generate-docs.sh

# View generated documentation
open docs/api/index.html  # API documentation
open docs/architecture/README.md  # Architecture overview
```

### Adding New ADRs
1. Copy the ADR template from `docs/architecture/adr/README.md`
2. Follow the format and include all required sections
3. Update the ADR index
4. Submit for team review

### Maintaining Documentation
- **Automated**: Run generation script regularly
- **Validation**: Use built-in validation checks
- **Updates**: Follow the maintenance process
- **Quality**: Adhere to documentation standards
