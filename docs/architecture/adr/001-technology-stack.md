# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2024-01-01

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for building the RichSlow Vietnamese stock market financial analysis web application. The application needs to:

- Fetch and process financial data from Vietnamese stock exchanges
- Provide a web interface for users to analyze financial statements
- Handle complex data structures and calculations
- Be scalable and maintainable for future enhancements
- Support real-time data when available

## Decision

We have chosen the following technology stack:

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python
- **Python 3.10+**: Language with excellent data processing libraries
- **Pydantic**: Data validation using Python type annotations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library
- **vnstock**: Specialized library for Vietnamese stock market data

### Frontend
- **Static HTML**: For simplicity and performance
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For interactivity without framework overhead
- **Session Storage**: For maintaining user state across pages

### Infrastructure
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
- **Static File Serving**: Built-in FastAPI static file handling
- **CORS**: Configured for development and production access

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid Development**: FastAPI and Python enable quick prototyping
- **Performance**: FastAPI provides excellent performance for API endpoints
- **Data Processing**: Pandas is perfect for financial data manipulation
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic provides runtime validation and documentation
- **Specialized Libraries**: vnstock handles Vietnamese market specifics
- **Simplicity**: Static frontend reduces complexity and deployment overhead

### Negative
- **Python Limitations**: Constrained to Python ecosystem for data processing
- **Scaling**: May require additional infrastructure for high traffic
- **Frontend Complexity**: Vanilla JavaScript may become complex with more features
- **Real-time Features**: Will require additional architecture for WebSocket support

- [ADR-003: Stateless Architecture](003-stateless-architecture.md)
- [ADR-004: Frontend Architecture](004-frontend-architecture.md)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Django with REST Framework
- **Pros**: Full-featured framework, admin interface, ORM
- **Cons**: More overhead, less suited for API-first applications

### Alternative 2: Node.js with Express
- **Pros**: JavaScript across stack, good for real-time features
- **Cons**: Less mature data processing libraries for financial analysis

### Alternative 3: React SPA with Python Backend
- **Pros**: Rich user interface, component-based architecture
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, build process, larger bundle size

## Rationale

The chosen stack provides the best balance of:

1. **Development Speed**: FastAPI and Python enable rapid development
2. **Performance**: Excellent for financial data processing and API serving
3. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns
4. **Scalability**: Can be scaled horizontally as needed
5. **Specialization**: vnstock library provides Vietnamese market expertise

The stack is particularly well-suited for financial applications due to Python's strong data processing ecosystem and FastAPI's excellent performance characteristics.

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Evaluate adding Celery for background processing tasks
- Plan for potential migration to microservices as complexity grows
- Consider adding database for historical data analysis features
