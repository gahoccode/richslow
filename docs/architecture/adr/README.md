# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the RichSlow project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

- **Status**: (Accepted | Rejected | Superseded | Deprecated)
- **Context**: The situation or problem that requires a decision
- **Decision**: The chosen solution and approach
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder as a result
- **Related Decisions**: Links to other ADRs that influence or are influenced by this one
